# Robert Wollny Truepill Coding Test

If I had more time I would have liked to get the table more pixel perfect, but with out the assets, and time this was as close as I could get it. Maybe with more time I would have like to create the table with CSS Grid.

Also the way that I added the dynamic classes based on the orderStatus not sure if this was the best way but this is what I could come up with. So with more time I would have liked to invesagate that further.
